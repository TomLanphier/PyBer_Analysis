# PyBer Analysis
## Overview
PyBer, a ride sharing app company, needed an analysis and vizualizations of their data to improve access and affordability for underserved neighborhoods. They provided two sets of  their data from 2019. The first contained the cities they service, the number of drivers in each city, and the type of city. The second contained the a unique id for each ride they had serviced, the date and time of the ride, the city it occurred in, and the fare for the ride. The primary focus is to examine how the other variables (rides, drivers, and fares) can be extrapolated to provide insight and information as functions of the type of city.

## Results
### PyBer Ride-Sharing Data Overview
The first comparison of data that we generated was the ride sharing data as a whole. In Figure 1, the average fair is plotted as a function of the total number of rides in each city. The size of the circle correlates with the number of PyBer drivers in the city, and the color inside the bubble indicates the type of city.

Figure 1. The average fare for a PyBer ride in a city plotted as a function of the number of PyBer rides in that city, with city types indicated by fill color and size of circle correlated to the number of drivers.

Rural cities appear to have fewer PyBer rides, more expensive average PyBer ride fares, and fewer PyBer drivers than suburban and urban cities. Urban cities tend to have more PyBer rides, cheaper average PyBer ride fares, and more PyBer drivers than suburban and rural cities. Suburban appears to be between urban and rural in those categories.
